## Why We Built Shorlabs

Deploying projects should be simple. You push your code, and it just works. No fiddling with infrastructure, no complicated CI/CD pipelines, no wasted time.

That's exactly what Shorlabs does.

### The Problem

Every developer has been there — you've built something great, but getting it live is a headache. Setting up servers, configuring build pipelines, managing environments. It takes hours when it should take seconds.

### Our Solution

Shorlabs connects to your GitHub repo and handles the rest. Push your code, and we build, deploy, and serve it. It's that simple.

### What's Next

We're just getting started. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build the future of deployments.
